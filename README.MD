# Passover C Project

A Project for the holiday given to Beer-Sheva University students in C language course.
Did half of it as a part of a private lesson

A program gets an input and responds accordingly:
1. Writes the menu for the user to operate the program
2. Gets 2 numbers and outputs for each number in the range whether it’s:
    - A special number
    - A perfect number
    - A Germain prime number
    - The lower member of a twin prime
    - ‘Just’ a prime number
